# Calculator App

This is a web app that resembles a basic calculator.

This was built as part of FreeCodeCamp's backend curriculum. This one was pure javascript and algorithm scripting. I like that I changed the normal function of the -/+ button because it makes more sense the way I have it than the ones on the TI-84s, but that's just my opinion.

## User Stories

### FreeCodeCamp

* User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
* User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.
* User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

### Personal User Stories

* User Story: I can exponentiate numbers. 
* User Story: I can do operations on than two numbers.  
* User Story: I can delete one number or I can clear everything.
